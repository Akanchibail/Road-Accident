🚦 Road Accident Analysis - Tableau Dashboard 🚦 <br>

📌 Project Overview <br>
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes road accident trends across the UK from 2019 to 2022. The dashboard enables users to analyze accident statistics, filter by severity, and compare year-over-year trends to gain data-driven insights into road safety.<br>

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)<br>
The dashboard tracks five major accident-related KPIs, with comparisons to the previous year:<br>
✔️ Total Accidents - Total number of reported accidents in the selected year.<br>
✔️ Total Casualties - Number of people affected in accidents.<br>
✔️ Fatal Casualties - Count of fatalities due to accidents.<br>
✔️ Serious Casualties - Number of severe injury cases.<br>
✔️ Slight Casualties - Total minor injuries recorded.<br>

📈 Visualizations Used<br>
The dashboard incorporates diverse visualization techniques to make data exploration insightful and intuitive:<br>

🚗 Chart - Casualties by Vehicle Type, tracking increases or decreases from the previous year.<br>
🌦️ Pie Chart - Casualties by Weather Condition, analyzing how different weather factors contribute to accidents.<br>
🛣️ Donut Chart - Casualties by Road Surface, showing the impact of wet, dry, and frosty road conditions.<br>
📊 Stacked Bar Chart - Casualties by Road Type, categorizing accidents across highways, single carriageways, roundabouts, and more.<br>
🗺️ Map Visualization - Casualties by Location, pinpointing accident hotspots across the UK.<br>

🎛️ Interactive Features<br>
The dashboard is highly interactive and responsive, allowing users to:<br>
🔹 Select different years (Current Year & Previous Year) to dynamically analyze trends.<br>
🔹 Filter by accident severity (Serious, Fatal, Slight) to focus on specific cases.<br>
🔹 Interact with all visual elements to update the dashboard in real time.<br>
